            <h1>Welcome!</h1>
            <h2>How about we start with a few things contained within this website?</h2>
            <h3>Home</h3>
            <p>This is my home page, you have reached your final destination.</p>
            <h3>Gallery</h3>
            <p>Contained within this page, images of my various projects and media are placed here,
                over there is an interactive 3D render created by me and my teammates.</p>
            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>This is actually the first page that I made within this entire project. This page is
                special to me since it is the first page that redefined my entire website.</p>
            <p>Handle with care.</p>
            <h3>Resume</h3>
            <p>My resume is contained within this page, if it looks to be too big, lower the zoom of
                your image. This is just the beginning of my resume page.</p>
            <h3>Digit-100/Reflection</h3>
            <p>This is the class that I made this website on, take this class seriously.</p>
            <p>Never let yourself get behind, or else it will really cost you.</p>
