            <h1>Reflective Essay</h1>
            <h2>Storm Shakoor</h2>
            <p>Possibly my biggest challenge so far was not asking for help. I am so used to just
                doing the work myself and therefore talked to no one until very late about if my
                code was not working and didn't know why, no one to ask for advice on small things
                that I would personally feel embarassed to ask about. For me, having a person who is
                doing the same thing as I am that I can talk to and exchange ideas is a massive
                boost to my learning process.</p>
            <p> Over a few times, my issues with laying out the code have been solved by wrapping
                everything in a div element inside the other tags and applying some form of
                organization to that, mainly wrapping content up to at least perform a good
                practice.</p>
            <p>I think the skills that I think are necessary to learn and develop these websites is
                HTML and CSS. HTML is especially important because it forms the foundation of all
                websites that exist, and provide the structure and content that web browsers
                commonly display, showing the creative structure and accessibility of web pages. The
                same can be said for CSS, because it is a powerful tool in website development that
                defines the styling and layout of web pages, making them more user friendly and
                accessible.</p>
            <p>Some skills that I would think that I want to improve on are HTML and file linking.
                Those two things were my biggest issues in the project, and file linking alone
                almost made me give up on the entire project altogether, combined with my lack of
                asking for help, it made it look way worse than it actually was. </p>
