At its heart, this is a discussion and the chance for two parties to come together with purpose. Negotiating involves many subtle skills, even in a purely professional and business setting. Good negotiators constantly seek out new ideas and knowledge. This strategy helps them gain the upper hand in negotiations as they apply their expertise in a practical setting. The art of psychology can tell us so much about other people and can be used during the negotiation process to identify how the people across the table from you feel and what their mindset might be like.","","2025-04-28 20:12:00","2025-04-28 20:12:11","2025-04-28 20:12:00","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en-GB","","","","","","","","","C:\Users\Mohid\Zotero\storage\QJ9USM3Y\the-psychology-of-negotiation.html","","web","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
